# TP2 Made by STANKOVIC Adrien, DURAT Nicolas and MAJOUL Mohamed in ST2TRD course
The path to .exe file is "TP2_ST2TRD/bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1/".  
We implement Caesar, Vigenere and Binary encryption method.  
The Caesar does not function well with Uppercase character.  
To use the load function on the app you have to write the full path to your docx/txt/csv, for exemple: "C:\Users\admin\Documents\TP2_ST2TRD\file.txt" and press Load.
